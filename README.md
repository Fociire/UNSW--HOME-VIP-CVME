# UNSW--HOME-VIP-CVME
This is a student project on the computer vision function of the robot.

Imagine a world where technology becomes so advanced that it has a conscience! Well, this isnâ€™t too far from the truth. Our team has been working on a project where we leverage the fields of Computer Vision and Machine Ethics to program a robot which can form its own moral decisions based on interactions with the environment, with a focus on designing ethical AI which we hope can be applied to infinitely many real world scenarios.

This project aims to program a robot (Jetbot) which would run based on the following steps.
- Robot receives a set of instructions from an external user.
- The robot computes these instructions and parses them into a PDDL planner.
- A list of ethical costs are computed based on the rankings of possible actions.
- Robot selects the course of actions which minimises the ethical costs involved (or the most moral set of actions that can be taken).
- Given the chosen set of instructions, the robot executes navigation toward completing the given objective, employing computer vision techniques for obstacle avoidance and object detection.
